                  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                  electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                  popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                  containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                  publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions.

                  On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
                  men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of
                  the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
                  and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those
                  who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as
                  saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
                  simple and easy to distinguish,
